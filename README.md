# websites
When researching ideas or looking for code snippets I sometimes come across small personal websites. 

[Simon Tatham](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/): Maintainer of several useful open source tools, most importantly PuTTY
[John Finnemore](http://johnfinnemore.blogspot.com/): Cryptic and funny, although not technically related
